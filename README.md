# Customer_Analytics
This is a usecase from Predictive Customer Analytics course.
We are checking the propensity of the customer while he is browsing on the website. I need to figure out when should the
company offer chat on the company's website. I have kept the threshold of 50%.
browsing.csv is the dataset which gives you the information of about whether user clicked while browsing on the company's website.
I have used Sklearn  library for Naive Bayes Classification Algorithm and accuracy of the model is 71.33%.
